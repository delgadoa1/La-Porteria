Family Use Website for Rental Properties in Medellin

A project for myself and my brother Alex to help our parents manage rental properties in the Medellin area. 

They are finally living their own life free of the responsibility of taking care of their children.

Hopefully, this site can be used to repay them for all their hard work they've endured while raising us.
They've sacrificed a lot to give us both all we have today and with this project we can help them in their retirement.
